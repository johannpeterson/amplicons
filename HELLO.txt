nijhawanlab/amplicons docker container
--------------------------------------
This container is usualy started using the start.sh script.  That
script binds the data directory (/home/bio/data) in the container to
the current directory from which it is run.

Once this container is started, copy the Makefile to the data
directory and run make.  E.g.,

> cp amplicons/Makefile data/
> cd data
> make help
> make all

If the variable SROUCE_DIR is set when running start.sh, the script
will bind the container's directory /home/bio/extsource to the
directory specified in that variable.  Otherwise it will bind
/home/bio/extsource to the default value of $HOME/bio/amplicons.  By
default, the environment variable EXT_SOURCE is set to 'false' in
the container.  The Makefile checks this variable to determine whether
to use the container's local copy of the amplicon source, or the
source directory on the host machine bound to /home/bio/extsource.
you can check this setting by running `make settings`, and looking for
the lines:

> use external source: false
> SOURCEDIR: /home/bio/amplicons

or

> use external source: true
> SOURCEDIR: /home/bio/extsource

near the top of the output.
