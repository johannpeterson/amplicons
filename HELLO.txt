nijhawanlab/amplicons docker container
--------------------------------------
This container is usualy started using the start.sh script.  That
script sets the data directory (/home/bio/data) to the current
directory from which it is run.  If the variable SOURCE_DIR is set,
it will bind the container's directory /home/bio/extsource to that
directory.  Otherwise it will bind /home/bio/extsource to the
default value of $HOME/bio/amplicons.

Once this container is started, copy the Makefile to the data
directory and run:

> cp amplicons/Makefile data/
> cd data
> make help
>
